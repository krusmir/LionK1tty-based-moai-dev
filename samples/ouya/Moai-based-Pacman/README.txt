--------Introduction--------

This is a prototype game based on the Moai game platform - http://getmoai.com. With various APIs for drawing and handling different 2D elements that Moai has supported, it clones a 2D Pacman game. 

I programmed the game for several objectives. Firstly, because I am just new to Moai, I try to familiarize myself with Moai's various APIs and game development based on it. I did encounter some issues when programming the game. Some were because I am a newbie for Moai, and some were testified later that were from Moai engine itself. Although the process was time-consuming, but to my pleasure, this is somewhat a contribution to the open source Moai engine itself. I feel a great joy to be part of it. Secondly, the whole game is based on OO. So I tried to program the whole game with a decent OO structure. Most importantly, some of the Lua classes or files, hopefully, can be reused in my other future potential games. 

All in all, I programmed Moai-based Pacman for fun and share my code, related game assets and documents here. If there can be any help for you who are interested in Moai and OO game programming, that would be my best honer.
